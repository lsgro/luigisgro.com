                    <p>Developing a software application means building new ways for humans to interact productively with a computer.</p>
                    <p>Like a specialised language, an application enables two-ways communication with a counterparty — the computing machine — for a specific goal.</p>
                    <p>When the machine is driven by the user to perform a task, it relays back some notion of its inner workings.</p>
                    <p>The fidelity of this feedback loop is essential to the quality of user experience: as with any sophisticated instrument, by using a computer 
                        we iteratively learn what it enables us to do, and we adjust, in response to that, the realm of our creative possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Arbitrary limitations, poor performance, lack of self-consistency, rather than being simply annoying traits of software applications,
                        which make our work more difficult than it needs to be, are in fact hampering our ability to reason in innovative ways: like an out-of-tune piano,
                        a poorly developed application affects creativity at its source, impeding an ideal user performance with its own idiosyncrasies and impossibilities.</p>
                    <p>Developing applications in a way that enables an empowering level of interaction is only possible by carefully and professionally mediating
                        between the client's applicative domain and a properly selected stack of technologies.</p>
                    <p>Minimum viable products, early and frequent releases are vital practices for success, but they must be accompanied by a speculative activity,
                        continuously challenging the current domain model, ready to revise and rework architecture and code when hypotheses are falsified.</p>
                    <p>Technical skills must not be a barrier to erect as a protection from the world, but the means for a developer to display and let
                        others experiment with a novel view of the world: a living thing that is destined to be tested, criticised, recast, amended, redone, improved perpetually,
                        precisely because there is value in it.</p>

                <div class="article-width">
                    <p>Like most of those born in the 1970s, I was obsessed with science fiction and electronics: I will never forget the joy, after I got my first home computer in 1982, when I saw
                    for the first time the cursor of the BASIC interpreter blinking on my TV screen.</p>
                    <p>For us, growing up in an analogical world, the sudden irruption of digital programmable things in our homes was revolutionary: 
                        learning to program in BASIC and machine code was as exciting as if I were allowed to an orbital trip on the Space Shuttle.</p>
                    <p>Later, while I was studying Electronic Engineering at the University of Genoa, I was introduced to Linux by a research assistant in the bioelectronics lab.</p>
                    <p>The World Wide Web was gaining popularity, and with it Open Source — the ability for anybody to read and compile the programs they used, down to the operating system.</p>
                    <p>With access to the high-speed network of the faculty, having time to study UNIX, browsing Linux source code, learning C and x86 assembly, this is when I knew what I wanted to do after university.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after graduating, I landed my first job as a C programmer, and since then I have been developing software for most of my career.</p>
                    <p>After C, Java became my default programming language, and years later Scala. I was following the main trends in backend programming: the big push for OOP in the nineties,
                        then the popularisation of functional languages thanks to Scala, Clojure and F#.</p>
                    <p>The typical path in a career was spending few years working hands on, then being promoted to middle management, to oversee the work of others and becoming progressively 
                        entangled in governance issues and power struggles. But for me the key to happiness at work was writing code and stay up-to-date with new technology.</p>
                    <p>The finance industry was becoming one of the biggest drivers of software innovation, providing increasing opportunities for experienced technical staff.
                        I moved to London in 2010, to work in a financial institution, while at the same time studying at Paul Wilmott's quantitative finance school in the evenings.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't always easy to reconcile working abroad with my family life, but eventually my wife and I managed to find an optimal compromise by both of us relocating to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>Looking for ways to keep working on interesting technical stuff, while achieving a higher degree of autonomy than what is normally allowed in traditional corporations, I started working
                        in the hedge fund industry, where I started building quantitative tools for risk management and trading algorithms in Scala and Python,
                        becoming more involved in pricing models and scientific computing.</p>
                    <p>A small developer team, sharing office with traders, is a congenial working environment for me. I am happy to delve in other disciplines deep enough to
                        find an angle from which users and computational power align in the most organic and effective way.</p>
                    <p>After several years of experience in this field and two successful green-field projects, I realised that I should take some time off,
                        away from all the necessary schedules and routine activities of company work, to let the latest experiences sediment, and get ready to start a new productive phase.</p>
