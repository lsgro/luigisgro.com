                    <p>Developing a software application means building new ways for humans to interact productively with a computer.</p>
                    <p>Like a specialised language, an application enables two-ways communication with a counterparty — the computing machine — for a specific goal.</p>
                    <p>When the machine is driven by the user to perform a task, it relays back some notion of its inner workings.</p>
                    <p>The fidelity of this feedback loop is essential to the quality of user experience: as with any sophisticated instrument, by using a computer 
                        we iteratively learn what it enables us to do, and we adjust, in response to that, the realm of our creative possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Arbitrary limitations, poor performance, lack of self-consistency, rather than being simply annoying traits of software applications,
                        which make our work more difficult than it needs to be, are in fact hampering our ability to reason in innovative ways: like an out-of-tune piano,
                        a poorly developed application affects creativity at its source, impeding an ideal user performance with its own idiosyncrasies and impossibilities.</p>
                    <p>Developing applications in a way that enables an empowering level of interaction is only possible by carefully and professionally mediating
                        between the client's applicative domain and a properly selected stack of technologies.</p>
                    <p>Minimum viable products, early and frequent releases are vital practices for success, but they must be accompanied by a speculative activity,
                        continuously challenging the current domain model, ready to revise and rework architecture and code when hypotheses are falsified.</p>
                    <p>Technical skills must not be a barrier to erect as a protection from the world, but the means for a developer to display and let
                        others experiment with a novel view of the world: a living thing that is destined to be tested, criticised, recast, amended, redone, improved perpetually,
                        precisely because there is value in it.</p>

                    <p>Growing up, like most children of my generation, obsessed with science fiction and electronics,
                        my dreams came true when, in 1982, my dad bough me a Commodore VIC-20 home computer.</p>
                    <p>It sounds silly today, but seeing for the first time the cursor of the BASIC
                    interpreter blinking on the TV screen gave me a joy I will never forget.
                    Exploration of the world contained in that bulky plastic keyboard became my main intellectual endeavour as a child.</p>
                    <p>Later, while I was studying to become an Electronic Engineer at the University of Genoa, I was introduced to Linux by a research assistant in the bioelectronics lab.</p>
                    <p>From that moment my life took a turn: I was so intrigued by open source — the ability for anybody to read and compile everything they used, down to the operating system —
                        that I started spending endless hours studying UNIX, browsing Linux source code, and experimenting with C and assembly to build my own toy operating system.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after graduating, I landed my first job as a C programmer, and since then I have been developing software for most of my career.</p> 
                    <p>After C, Java became my language of choice, and years later Scala. I was following the main trends in backend programming: the big push for OOP in the nineties,
                        then the popularisation of functional languages thanks to Scala, Clojure and F#.</p>
                    <p>I left Italy in 2010, to work in a financial institution in London, while at the same time studying at Paul Wilmott's quantitative finance school in the evenings.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't always easy to reconcile working abroad with my family life, but eventually my wife and I managed to find an optimal compromise by both of us relocating to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>Here I had the opportunity to experience life in a hedge fund's front office: I started building quantitative tools for risk management and trading algorithms in Scala and Python,
                        becoming more involved in pricing models and scientific computing.</p>
                    <p>After several laborious years and two successful green-field projects I realised that, to continue learning and being creative, I should take some time off,
                        away from all the necessary schedules and routine activities of corporate work.</p>
                    <p>While I am spending time experimenting with machine learning and algo-trading, doing sport and travelling, I am looking forward to the next exciting project.</p>
